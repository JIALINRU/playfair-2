<h4>Overview</h4>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher" target="_blank">Playfair cipher</a>
is a pencil and paper cipher designed in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone but named
after Lord Playfair who promoted its use.
<h4>The Key</h4>
<p>The key is a 5x5 Polybius square containing 25 of the 26 capital letters of the English
alphabet. In this application, <tt>I</tt> and <tt>J</tt> are combined. In others,
letters such as <tt>Q</tt> or </tt>X</tt> may be dropped. The order of the letters
within the square is critical. If the person with whom you're exhanging the message
doesn't have their square in the same order as you, then they will not be able to
correctly exchange messages with you. The sequencing of the key is made more simple
by using a Keyphrase.</p>
<h4>The Keyphrase</h4>
<p>The keyphrase is an alphabetic sequence (usually a word or set of words) which are used
to change the order of the Polybius Square. You and the person with whom you are
exchanging the message must have the same key to decipher the other's messages.
Because the most sensitive part of the process is the key, you should keep the keyphrase
secret and ensure a mechanism of rotating the keyphrase. A common method of rotating keys
is to use a book which both of you have and a pre-arranged algorithm for finding
the day's keyphrase within that book.</p>
<p>If you wish to specify the full square rather than just a beginning keyphrase,
simply enter all 25 letters of the key into the Keyphrase box</p>
<h4>Encrypting</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Enter the keyphrase into the <em>Keyphrase</em> box</li>
  <li>Enter the message you wish to encrypt into the <em>Message</em> box</li>
  <li>Click the <em>Encrypt</em> button</li>
  <li>The encrypted message appears in the <em>Message</em> box</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that the alphabet for this is 25 upper-case letters. So everything that
is not a letter is removed, and all letters are converted to upper-case. If you check
the <em>Convert &quot;<tt>.</tt>&quot; to &quot;<tt>STOP</tt>&quot;</em> checkbox,
all periods will be changed to the word &quot;STOP&quot; so that you at least get
sentence endings in the result. Similarly, if you check <em>Spell out digits</em>,
numbers will be spelled out digit-by-digit.</p>
<h4>Decrypting</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Enter the keyphrase into the <em>Keyphrase</em> box</li>
  <li>Enter the encrypted message into the <em>Message</em> box</li>
  <li>Click the <em>Decrypt</em> button</li>
  <li>The plaintext message appears in the <em>Message</em> box</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;The decrypted message isn't the same as I put it in.&quot;</strong> or
<strong>&quot;I can't read the new decrypted message&quot;</strong></p>
Remember, this is an alphabet of only 25 characters, and doesn't include punctuation.
So the resulting plaintext will probably not be exactly the same as you originally
entered. Here are some hints to get you started:
<ul>
  <li>You'll need to figure out where word boundaries are. When constructing your
  plaintext message, help out the recipient by removing any ambiguity in the 
  boundaries of the plaintext message. For example: &quot;<tt>TOPANDASYNCHRONOUS</tt>&quot;
  might be construed as &quot;<tt>TOP AND A SYNCHRONOUS</tt>&quot; or &quot;<tt>TOP AND ASYNCHRONOUS</tt>&quot;
  or even &quot;<tt>TO PANDA SYNCRHONOUS</tt>&quot;</li>
  <li><tt>J</tt>'s from the plaintext are converted to <tt>I</tt>'s.</li>
  <li>To avoid letter frequency issues of normal substitution ciphers, the Playfair
  cipher converts a message into pairs of letters. A single pair cannot contain a
  repeating letter, so an &quot;X&quot; will be inserted between them. If the decrypted
  message contains &quot;<tt>NOXON</tt>&quot;, the original was <strong>probably</strong>
  &quot;<tt>NOON</tt>.</li>
  <li>Even if <em>Convert &quot;<tt>.</tt>&quot; to &quot;<tt>STOP</tt>&quot;</em>
  and <em>Spell out digits</em> are selected, these processes will not be reversed
  when decrypting. There's simply no good automated way to determine if &quot;<tt>PASTOPEN</tt>&quot;
  means &quot;<tt>past open</tt>&quot; or &quot;<tt>pa. en</tt>&quot; or if
  &quot;<tt>FALSEVENT</tt>&quot; should be &quot;<tt>FAL7VENT</tt>&quot; or
  &quot;<tt>FALSE VENT</tt>&quot;.
  <li>If the last digraph only includes one letter, a &quot;<tt>Z</tt>&quot; will be
  appended. If the last &quot;<tt>Z</tt>&quot; doesn't make sense, just drop it.</li>
